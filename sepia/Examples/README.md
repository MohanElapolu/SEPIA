### Example notebooks

#### `univariate_example.ipynb`
A simple synthetic-data example where the response variable is univariate.
Demonstrates setting up the model, doing MCMC, and doing predictions.

#### `multivariate_example.ipynb`
A synthetic-data example where the response variable is multivariate.

#### `multivariate_example_with_prediction.ipynb`
A synthetic-data example where the response variable is multivariate.
Predictions of various kinds are done after MCMC.

#### Ball_Drop
A more involved synthetic-data example that uses physics equations to generate data
that might be observed from dropping balls off of a tower.

#### Al_5083
A real data example using features extracted from velocimetry curves in a flyer plate impact
experiment involving aluminum.
