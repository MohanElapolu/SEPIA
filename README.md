# SEPIA

Simulation-Enabled Prediction, Inference, and Analysis: physics-informed statistical learning.
This is a Python adaptation of [GPMSA](https://github.com/lanl/gpmsa).

### Warning: Construction Area. SEPIA is under development!
Basic functionality (model setup, likelihood evaluation, and mcmc sampling, multivariate calibration, predictions) is complete and has been tested against GPMSA matlab.
Some features are untested or still being developed (visualization and diagnostics, sensitivity analysis).

Users should pull the newest code frequently, particularly if you encounter errors.
If you have installed using the instructions below, you should not need to reinstall after pulling new code -- the updated code should automatically be tied into your existing sepia installation.

### Documentation
Current documentation is at [Read the Docs](http://sepia-lanl.readthedocs.io).
The documentation contains a workflow guide that is helpful for new users to read, and also contains a quick reference for basic commands as well as an API.

### Examples
Basic usage is demonstrated in the Examples directory. 
After looking at the documentation, check out the examples.

### Install package locally
We recommend doing this inside a python conda environment.
The packages installed in the development environment are listed in `environment.yml`.
Use `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create the environment, then activate as `source activate sepia` before installing sepia.

Then use the following command from this directory to install sepia locally.

`pip install -e .[sepia]`
