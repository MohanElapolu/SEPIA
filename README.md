# SEPIA

Simulation-Enabled Prediction, Inference, and Analysis: physics-informed statistical learning.
This will be the python version of [GPMSA](https://github.com/lanl/gpmsa)

### Warning: still under development!
Basic functionality (model setup, likelihood evaluation, and mcmc sampling) is complete and has been tested against GPMSA matlab.
Some features are untested or still being developed (like auto step size tuning and sensitivity analysis).

### Examples
Basic usage is demonstrated in the Examples directory. 
Follow one of these examples but plugging in your own data.

### Install package locally
After cloning git repo, use the following command from this directory to install locally.

`pip install -e .[sepia]`

 I recommend doing this inside a python conda environment.
 The packages installed in the development environment are listed in `environment.yml`.
Use `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create the environment, then activate as `source activate sepia` before installing sepia.

### Documentation
You can build it locally if you wish following docs/README.md, or view version on
[Read the Docs](http://sepia-lanl.readthedocs.io).
